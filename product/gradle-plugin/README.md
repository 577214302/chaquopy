# Browsing Android Gradle plugin source code

If not using Google "repo" tool, the following procedure should work:

* Check out the following Android repositories at the desired version:
   * manifest
   * tools/buildSrc
   * tools/base
   * tools/gradle
   * Any other repositories referenced from tools/base/.idea/modules.xml.
* Copy files from tools/buildSrc as indicated in the manifest.
* Open tools/base as a project in IDEA.
