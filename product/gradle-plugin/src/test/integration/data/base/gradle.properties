# 1536M has been the default heap size in projects generated by Android Studio since 2017 or
# even earlier. The Gradle default is 512M
# (https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:configuring_jvm_memory),
# but this frequently causes OutOfMemoryErrors in the packageDebug task, which doesn't appear
# to be caused by us.
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx1536m

# Gradle Daemon will terminate itself after specified number of idle milliseconds. Default is
# 10800000 (3 hours), but that can overload the machine when running integration tests on many
# versions. Reduce to 30 minutes.
