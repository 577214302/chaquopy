# As of Android Studio 3.6, the IDE generates this file with a max heap size of 1536M. However,
# the Gradle default is still 512M

# Gradle Daemon will terminate itself after specified number of idle milliseconds. Default is
# 10800000 (3 hours), but that can overload the machine when running integration tests on many
# versions. Reduce to 30 minutes.
