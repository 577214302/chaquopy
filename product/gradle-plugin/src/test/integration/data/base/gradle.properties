# When configured, Gradle will run in incubating parallel mode.
# This option should only be used with decoupled projects. More details, visit

# Gradle Daemon will terminate itself after specified number of idle milliseconds. Default is
# 10800000 (3 hours), but that can overload the machine when running integration tests on many
# versions. Reduce to 30 minutes.
