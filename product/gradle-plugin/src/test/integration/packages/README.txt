The package files in dist/ and ../data/ were generated by running one or both of the following
commands in the src/ subdirectories:

    python setup.py bdist_wheel --universal
    python setup.py sdist

Some of the scripts require extra arguments: see comments.

Some of the packages were then renamed to meet the needs of the tests.
