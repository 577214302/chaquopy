# With Gradle 3.3 on Windows, cmake build output is truncated or turned into blank lines, even when
# running gradlew within a cmd window. With 3.5, this only happens when launching it from the
# Android Studio Gradle view: everywhere else is fine, including the Android Studio Terminal view.
#
# In a later recurrence of this problem with pip, I found it was caused by subprocesses writing
# "\r\n" to stdout. Presumably the \r causes some internal terminal emulator to go back to the
# start of the line, and the \n causes the line to be blanked out.
