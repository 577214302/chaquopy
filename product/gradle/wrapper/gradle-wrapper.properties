# The Chaquopy Gradle plugin will be built against this version of the gradleApi() dependency
# (https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/1835). Increasing this to 7.0.2 resulted in a plugin
# which was incompatible with Gradle 6
# (https://discuss.gradle.org/t/my-plugin-cant-be-applied-when-plugin-is-built-with-gradle-7-1-1/40464
# and https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin/issues/193). So don't change it until
# Gradle 6 is below our minimum requirement -- in fact, so far below that it isn't even being
# tested by AndroidPlugin.test_old.
